	"description": "As we continue to explore the beating heart of the cult in search of the other half of the all-powerful artefact, we must not forget the warnings we were given: the artefact can only be used once against the beholder leading the cult and cannot be brought to the surface. The price for disobeying either directive is death and we’d be wise to heed the words of the god tasked with guarding the ancient object. Once we’re done with the device – if we actually prevail against the beholder – we’re to return the completed item to the temple so that the god may destroy it, ending the servitude he and his followers are bound to do. \n\nIt’s only by a technicality that the eternal vigil is ending, but I feel that both the god and his worshippers have more than fulfilled their end of the bargain. The item had been all-but forgotten, its power waning as the centuries rolled by. Once the beholder is no more, there’ll only be Terri’s party and those at the temple who remember its existence and fewer still who know its purpose. For those who have given everything to guard the device, the only reward worthy of their sacrifice is the end of their vigil and with it, eternity at peace alongside their god.\n\nTo sleep, perchance to dream.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Kikoskia\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/kikoskia\nDiscord: https://discordapp.com/invite/X2YUmPh\n",
